.SH NAME
checkforbz2footer \- Check if bzip2 file ends with bz2 magic footer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B checkforbz2footer
[\fI--version|--help\fR]
.br
.B checkforbz2footer
\fI<infile>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Check whether the specified bzip2 compressed file ends with a bz2 footer
or not ((i.e. if it is truncated or corrupted).
This is a crude but fast test for integrity; we don't check the CRC at
the end of the stream, nor do we check the bit padding in the last byte
of the file.
.PP
Exits with 0 if the file has the bz2 footer, 1 if the file does not have
the footer and \fB\-1\fR on error.
