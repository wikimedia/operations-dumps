This is a bare bones converter of MediaWiki XML dumps to sql.
It does one thing and hopefully at least doesn't suck at it.
If you want the swiss army knife of converters, better shop
elsewhere.

To install this program, you will need to have the libssl,
libcrypto, libz and bz2 development libraries installed,
as well as the gcc toolchain or an equivalent C compiler
and its supporting libraries. You'll also need the 'make'
utility.

This program has been tested only on 64-bit Linux.  You can
try building it on other platforms but without any support
from the author.  If you do build it on another platform and
run it successfully, let us know and we'll include that
information here.

INSTALLATION

Unpack the distribution someplace, cd into it, 'make'
and if you like 'make install'.  The binary will be
installed into /usr/local/bin.  If you want it someplace
else, edit the Makefile and change the line
'PREFIX=/usr/local'  as desired.

RUNNING

'mwxml2sql --help' will give you a comprehensive usage
message.

TL;DR version:  you need a page xml.bz2/gz file and a
stubs xml bz2/gz file for input, sql files for the page,
revision and text tables will be produced on output.

Example use:

mwxml2sql -v -s testing/enwiki-stubs-1114-1300.gz \
         -t testing/enwiki-pages-1114-1300.gz  \
         -f testing/sql_enwiki-1114-1300.gz -p t_ -m 1.20

-v: print progress messages
-s: stubs file for input
-t: text (page content) file for input
-f: filename used to build the page/revision/text output filenames
    in this case the files sql_enwiki-1114-1300-page.sql.gz,
    sql_enwiki-1114-1300-revs.sql.gz and sql_enwiki-1114-1300-text.sql.gz
    are produced
-p: prefix of tables in your database (correpsonds to $wgDBprefix
    in LocalSetting.php, leave out this option if you have no prefix)
-m: MediaWiki version for which to produce output

WARNINGS

This has been tested only for output MediaWiki 1.20 and input xsd 0.7
and not very comprehensively.  Please help discover bugs!
