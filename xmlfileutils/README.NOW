The files that used to reside here in the nice cozy ariel branch,
i.e. mwxml2sql.c and friends, as well as scripts such as
wikiretriever.py, have all moved to their own repo. You can
find them at
   operations/dumps/import-tools/
in the master branch, subdirectory 'xmlfileutils'.

Bug reporting and everything else remains the same.
