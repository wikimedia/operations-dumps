100 continue support for PUT object (sometimes we might get a redir after sending all the data otherwise,
    see  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTRedirect.html)
make sure that we always tear down all connections (which we don't reuse, so any new conn = we tore down 
    the old one)
keep-alive, when do we want it? 
connection at s3session level maybe (for multiple requests over one connection)? right now it's one conn 
    per request
clean up/add Location header handling generally

size hint header for archive.org for dumps!!

virtualhost stuff (it's implemented --brokenly--, untested, etc)

pretty print xml replies only if we want? a flag, an arg?  or we print when we get the response back??
make sure all verbose prints have labelled what they are printing (example: arg dicts)
too verbose when --verbose is off, clean that up too

move requestinfo into handler and out of main? 
utf8 in meta fields, do we need to do anything about this?? how about in filenames or bucket names?

all fixmes

suport https (do we need to do server verification of certs? ooouuucch if we do. but otherwise
  we are open to MITM. I guess first round will not verify.
check what google storage extensions are or if it needs anything interesting
resume upload (see gsutils)

timeout for read of content-length (or especially when there is none), don't want to hang if the 
  server goes out to lunch

maybe be better about some of the import statements, there's rather a lot of stuff listed, also 
  lose any we don't need

suppose I want a file to remove some args from a previous parent class (like wmfarchive maybe 
  doesn't want the title arg to be passed around... though it could be in the config file 
  anyways, ugh)... handle this

short forms for options: operation, bucket, remotefile, localfile, configfile, verbose, quiet
are all mandatory args specified for all ops? when do we not need accsskey secret key for listing
    stuff (maybe for listing contents of someone's bucket)?

parse xml back from allcommands that show it (listing buckets, etc) and display those results instead
add specific wmf useragent string to wmfarchive.py
see how much of the cookie stuff we can do via the python libraries
in some routines like verifyobject they seemed to work even though we setUrlInfo from argDict
    and not self.argDict (this is now fixed in the code), is there pollution of the namespace
    from someplace? check this. note that a corresponding error in getbucketiametadata called
    however from wmfarchive.py *did* error out as it should have
