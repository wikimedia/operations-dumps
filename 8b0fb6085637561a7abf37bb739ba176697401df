      "message": "Before this commit cleanOldDumps was run for all runs, except for \"--job\" runs without an existing index.html.\n\nHowever, cleanOldDumps does not consider index.html. It just considers dumpDirs.\nAnd the function properly handles an already existing dumpDir with today\u0027s date.\n\nAfter this commit cleanOldDumps is run on all invocations. This adds a not measurable performance penalty for --job runs having a dumpdir with todays date.\n\nHowever, it greatly improves the readability of the invocation of cleanOldDumps.\nFurthermore, now all invocations of cleanOldDumps are just below the makeDir lines (1850/1851). Hence, it is obvious that the dump now exists /before/ the invocation.",
