keep-alive, when do we want it? 

connection at s3session level maybe (for multiple requests over one connection)? right now it's one conn 
    per request

all fixmes

make sure that we always tear down all connections (which we don't reuse, so any new conn = we tore down 
    the old one and we don't accumulate tons of them in an "uploadobjectasmp" for example)

suport https (do we need to do server verification of certs? ooouuucch if we do. but otherwise
  we are open to MITM. I guess first round will not verify.

check what google storage extensions are or if it needs anything interesting

resume upload (see gsutils)

timeout for read of content-length (or especially when there is none), don't want to hang if the 
  server goes out to lunch

maybe be better about some of the import statements, there's rather a lot of stuff listed, also 
  lose any we don't need

see how much of the cookie stuff we can do via the python libraries

non quiet should display the server response body in case of error response? if it's xml maybe so, decide something and implement

when verifiyobject fails it ought (?) to return in some fashion a failure code so that __main__ or the caller can be 
  informed; currently the caller just gets the http status codes (which of course will be "good")
