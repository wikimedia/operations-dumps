.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dumpbz2filefromoffset
[\fI--version|--help\fR]
.br
.B dumpbz2filefromoffset
\fI<infile> <offset>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Find the first bz2 block in a file after the specified offset, uncompress
and write contents from that point on to stdout, starting with the first
<page> tag encountered.
.PP
The starting <mediawiki> tag and the <siteinfo> header from the file will
be written out first.

Note that some bytes from the very last block may be lost if the blocks are
not byte\-aligned. This is due to the bzip2 crc at the eof being wrong.
.PP
Exits with BZ_OK on success, various BZ_ errors otherwise.
